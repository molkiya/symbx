CHOOSING A LICENSE

If you are using SymbX in an open source project that is licensed under
AGPL-3.0 or a compatible license, you may use SymbX under the AGPL-3.0
license. This means you must also open source your derivative works.

If you are using SymbX in a proprietary product, SaaS application, or
any other context where you cannot or do not want to open source your
code, you must obtain a commercial license. Please contact the author
to discuss commercial licensing terms and pricing.
